# XOR Gate using MP Model 

Programmed as an assignment for the Neural Networks Curriculum(CS1104) in SRM University. Used the Mcculloch Pitts to represent the XOR Gate. Used Hidden Layers as the problem is not solvable by linear seperability without the usage of hidden layers.

The Program automatically calculates the weight between layers in the Neural Net.
